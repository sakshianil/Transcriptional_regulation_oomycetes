# **Deciphering Transcriptional Regulation in Plant Pathogeenic Oomycetes using high resolution RNA sequencing**

## **Overview**
Welcome to the repository for the research on **Transcriptional Regulation in Oomycetes**, part of a PhD thesis under the guidance of **Prof. Dr. Marco Thines**. This study explores the regulatory pathways controlling transcription in oomycetes, organisms that are pivotal in plant pathology and environmental biology. The research has been supported by a collaboration of esteemed institutions:

- **Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (SBiK-F)**, Senckenberg Gesellschaft f√ºr Naturforschung, Frankfurt, Germany
- **Department of Biological Sciences**, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany
- **Center for Integrative Fungal Research (IPF)**, Frankfurt, Germany
- **LOEWE Centre for Translational Biodiversity Genomics (TBG)**, Frankfurt, Germany

The aim of this research is to illuminate the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation in oomycetes, using high-throughput sequencing and advanced bioinformatics. The repository includes code for data preprocessing, comprehensive analysis and visualization of promoter region, contributing to a better understanding of these organisms.

This project is divided into three main parts, each focused on a specific aspect of transcriptional regulation in oomycetes:

1. **Pl_halstedii_study**: Analysis and scripts related to _Plasmopara halstedii_.
2. **orthologs_motifs_study**: Discovery and analysis of conserved motifs in orthologous oomycete genomes.
3. **orthologs_TF_study**: Identification and analysis of transcription factors (TFs) across multiple oomycete genomes.

For a visual overview of each study, please refer to the following pipeline images:

## **Directory Structure**
The repository follows an organized structure to streamline the computational workflow:

- **`data/`**: Houses datasets at different stages.
  - **`raw/`**: Original unprocessed data files.
  - **`processed/`**: Data that has been cleaned and transformed for downstrean gene expression analysis.
  - **`support/`**: Supporting files including **FASTA**, **GTF**, and **GFF** files essential for annotation.

- **`scripts/`**: Computational scripts for data analysis and pipeline execution.
  - **`R/`**: Scripts written in R for time-series gene expreession analysis and visualization.
  - **`python/`**: Python scripts for data parsing, cleaning and manipulation.
  - **`shell/`**: Shell scripts to automate workflows and perform batch tasks.
  - **`perl/`**: Perl scripts for targeted data processing requirements (eg. for MEME suite).

- **`results/`**: Contains generated outputs, tables and key analysis results.
- **`docs/`**: Project documentation, including notes, methodology and comments.
- **`figures/`**: Visualizations generated during analysis for publication and presentations.
